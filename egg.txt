Got it 👍 — thanks for clarifying how Pro works on top of Flash. Let me structure this step by step so stakeholders can easily understand:


---

🌐 Two-Layer Validation Framework

We have two levels of judgment:

1. Flash Confidence (Layer 1):
Assigns High, Medium, Low based on how strongly the L6 aligns with the theme definition.

High Confidence:

L6 directly and primarily maps to the theme.

Relationship is clear, specific, and strong.

No other themes are equally or more relevant.


Medium Confidence:

L6 is partially related (theme relevant but not main focus).

Some alignment exists at higher taxonomy levels.

Other themes may also apply.


Low Confidence:

L6 has no clear relationship to the theme.

Match is vague, indirect, or mostly unrelated.






---

2. Pro Validation (Layer 2):
Pro does not independently assign High/Medium/Low — it validates Flash’s choice using:

Log probability (log prob) confidence from model reasoning.

A check if Flash’s label matches Pro’s internal interpretation.

If match → Valid; if mismatch → Invalid.




So:

Valid = Pro agrees with Flash’s confidence.

Invalid = Pro disagrees (confidence mismatch).



---

🔄 Combined Interpretation

Now let’s map combinations across the two layers:


---

1. High (Flash) + Valid (Pro) → ✅ Strong Accept

Flash Meaning: L6 directly and primarily fits the theme.

Pro Meaning: Confirms alignment and agrees with Flash’s confidence.

Interpretation: These are gold-standard matches, minimal review needed.



---

2. High (Flash) + Invalid (Pro) → ⚠️ Conflict – Review

Flash Meaning: Strongly confident in L6.

Pro Meaning: Disagrees; log prob indicates over-confidence or misalignment.

Interpretation: Rare but important. Flash thought it was strong, but Pro flagged doubts. Needs manual review.



---

3. Medium (Flash) + Valid (Pro) → ⚖️ Borderline – Review

Flash Meaning: L6 partially fits, not main focus.

Pro Meaning: Confirms this “medium” assignment.

Interpretation: These are valid but weaker links, worth reviewing to decide whether to include for broader coverage.



---

4. Medium (Flash) + Invalid (Pro) → ⚠️ Uncertain – Review

Flash Meaning: Unsure, weaker alignment.

Pro Meaning: Disagrees; mismatch in confidence interpretation.

Interpretation: Likely false positives. Still reviewable because they may capture edge cases.



---

5. Low (Flash) + Valid (Pro) → ❌ Reject

Flash Meaning: No strong connection to theme.

Pro Meaning: Surprisingly agrees Flash is right to assign Low.

Interpretation: These are too weak to keep, even if “valid.” Reject to maintain precision.



---

6. Low (Flash) + Invalid (Pro) → ❌ Strong Reject / Review Safeguard

Flash Meaning: Very weak or irrelevant.

Pro Meaning: Disagrees with even the weak confidence, flagging mismatch.

Interpretation: Almost certainly noise. Mark for reject, but small review buffer if risk tolerance is very low.



---

📌 Stakeholder Summary

High Confidence + Pro Valid → Trustworthy inclusions.

Medium Confidence (any outcome) → Grey zone needing human judgment.

Low Confidence (any outcome) → Exclusions to protect quality.

Invalid outcomes → Disagreements that always trigger review.



---

👉 This way, stakeholders see what each confidence means individually (Flash vs. Pro) and then how the two interact.

Would you like me to turn this into a Confluence-style 2-layer table (Flash → Pro → Final Decision → Stakeholder Meaning) so it’s easy to drop into your documentation?
