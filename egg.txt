Here is an optimized, crisp, non-repetitive version while keeping every theme intact. I’ve grouped overlapping points, removed duplicates, and improved flow:

Optimized & Consolidated Areas of Development

1. Planning, Prioritization & Ownership
Strengthen time management and structured planning to balance multiple projects more effectively. Begin taking fuller ownership of tasks, reduce dependency on senior colleagues, and practice proactive decision-making to build leadership foundations.

2. Communication & Engagement
Be more vocal and confident in team discussions, actively contribute perspectives, and continue improving clarity, storytelling, and stakeholder-oriented communication—both in presentations and day-to-day interactions.

3. Knowledge of Internal Processes
Maintain strong awareness of HSBC policies, compliance requirements, and internal procedures to avoid inadvertent breaches.

4. Knowledge Sharing & Collaboration
Increase the frequency of documentation, walkthroughs, and sharing learnings with peers to support team growth and collective productivity.

5. Technical & Domain Upskilling
Continue building depth in Data Engineering (pipelines, DQ, automation, scalable frameworks), expand GenAI skills (prompt engineering, model evaluation, use-case exploration), and further strengthen Asset Management domain expertise for future ownership.

6. Broader AM Participation & Growth Mindset
Engage more in wider AM initiatives such as volunteering, NOVA, coaching circles, and other AMDAO activities. Actively seek stretch assignments and learning opportunities that help expand scope and accelerate growth.

If you'd like, I can also rewrite this in a more formal tone, bullet-point format, or as a paragraph for a performance review.
