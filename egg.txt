Got it ✅ — let’s break this into 4 slides so each concept (Self-Consistency and Generated Knowledge Prompting) gets an Intro + How it works/Benefits slide. That way you can present with more clarity without cramming too much on one slide.


---

Slide 1: Self-Consistency — Introduction

Title: Self-Consistency in Prompt Engineering

Key Points:

Definition: A prompting technique that improves Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning by sampling multiple reasoning paths.

Goal: Find the most reliable answer by aggregating outputs instead of relying on a single response.

Why: Models sometimes give different answers depending on random sampling → this method reduces errors.


Visual:
One question → multiple CoT reasoning paths (A, B, C…)

Slide 2: Self-Consistency — How It Works & Benefits

Title: How Self-Consistency Improves Accuracy

Steps:

1. Use CoT prompting.


2. Increase randomness (temperature > 0).


3. Generate multiple outputs.


4. Select the final answer via majority vote or probability aggregation.



Benefits:

Improves accuracy on reasoning tasks (e.g., math word problems, commonsense).

More reliable than single-path CoT.

Shown to boost performance in benchmarks like GSM8K, SVAMP, AQuA.

Slide 3: Generated Knowledge Prompting — Introduction

Title: Generated Knowledge Prompting

Key Points:

Definition: Ask the model to generate background knowledge before answering the main question.

Goal: Improve context, factual grounding, and reasoning.

Use Cases: Commonsense reasoning, Q&A, story generation, knowledge-heavy domains.


Visual:
Prompt → Model generates “fact list” → Then answer.

Slide 4: Generated Knowledge Prompting — Methods & Benefits

Title: How Generated Knowledge Helps

Methods:

Single-Step: Generate knowledge + answer in one prompt.

Two-Step (better):

1. Prompt for knowledge.


2. Feed it back to answer main query.




Benefits:

Anchors answers with context.

Reduces hallucinations.

Improves reasoning without retraining models.


Visual:
