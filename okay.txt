Here’s a simple, natural, one-paragraph version of your introduction, written in your own style and voice:

Introduction

This year has been a fulfilling journey with contributions across multiple areas of data science and leadership. I started the year with the successful delivery of the ESG Score Project for IQ Lab and moved on to leading and contributing to the Thematic Portfolio project, focusing on signal development and completing the Green Share calculation. Alongside project delivery, I’ve been actively involved in mentoring interns, several of whom transitioned to full-time roles, and have led or presented in multiple Data Lunch & Learn sessions and internal showcases. These experiences have helped me strengthen both my technical and leadership skills, while contributing to collaboration, knowledge sharing, and innovation across the team.

Would you like me to make the transition sentence lead smoothly into the first goal (so it reads like a continuous review document)?






Here’s your MLOps Working Group section divided into Overview and Contributions, keeping it crisp and aligned with your self-assessment tone:

Project Summary – MLOps Working Group

Overview
As part of the MLOps Working Group, I took a leading role in exploring and operationalising Vertex AI for model lifecycle management. The focus was to assess how Vertex AI could streamline training, deployment, monitoring, and governance within HSBC AM’s AI ecosystem. We demonstrated its capabilities in Maple Quad, presenting a live end-to-end example of how model workflows could be automated and scaled securely. The initiative positioned the team to adopt a more standardised and efficient approach to MLOps across projects.

Contributions
I coordinated cross-team discussions, designed initial workflows, and identified a pilot project to pioneer Vertex AI deployment in production. I guided the team through technical evaluation sessions, documented key integration challenges, and worked closely with engineering to align on environment setup, governance, and CI/CD practices. I also supported showcasing the prototype during internal forums, highlighting its potential to reduce manual deployment time and improve traceability. The project is now progressing toward full implementation as a reference model for future MLOps efforts.

Would you like me to add a short “Reflection” section afterward to summarise what went well and what you plan to improve for next year?



Here’s how you could frame the Intern and Line Management section of your self-assessment so it reads naturally and shows mentoring depth.

Intern Management and Line Leadership

Overview
This year, my role evolved from mentoring interns to taking on formal line-management responsibilities as one of them transitioned into a full-time position. This shift required balancing technical guidance with people-leadership skills—helping new team members navigate expectations, understand workflows, and build confidence as they adapted to the team culture.

Contributions
I established a structured learning plan with clear milestones and regular one-to-one sessions focused on progress review, technical challenges, and professional development. I actively gathered feedback from senior team members and translated it into actionable coaching points, helping the mentees strengthen their analytical and communication skills. I also worked on building trust and psychological safety, ensuring they felt supported while taking ownership of their work.

Reflection
This experience reinforced my belief in mentorship as a key part of leadership. I learned to adapt my communication style to different learning needs and to strike a balance between autonomy and guidance. Moving forward, I aim to formalise this approach by developing a lightweight onboarding and mentoring framework that can be reused for future hires or interns.
